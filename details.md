Validation and distribution of actual overlappings becomes an important part of those [Organized Networks](http://nedrossiter.org/?p=371).<br />&nbsp;
* **Community Building** : Harmonious Hackathons
* **Research** : intentional, distributed action
* **Open Source** : Leaving proprietary social networks
